# World Generation

The world is a 2D randomly generated indoor environment constructed of rooms, corridors, doors ect. The world generation needs to produce several *important* rooms that are needed for gameplay; For example, there needs to be a nuclear reactor and several rooms controlling subsystems of the nuclear reactor. The world is allowed to have initially areas; very few things are actually impassable in a world with time-travel and / or multiverse jumping, but the generation must ensure that there is a way at some point in the timeline to get into a room.

Parts of the world can be destroyed by explosives, but parts should be non-destructable to force players to find alternative routes via tunnels, keys and time-travel
