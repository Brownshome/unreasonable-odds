The universe is a small hand crafted 2D world with a nuclear reactor in the middle. The nuclear reactor is the source of time-travel energy. This reactor will meltdown in 5 minutes destroying the whole universe. Time-travel gets more and more expensive based on the number of universes that have been created. Players can quickly charge directly from the reactor, which increases its heat. Which causes it to meltdown faster. Drawing energy from a reactor that failed in any way decreases the amount of time that it has before it explodes. Drawing power from a non-failed reactor does not deteriorate it.

The first player that stabalises the reactor wins. Stabalising the reactor requires information from other timelines / multiple people.

The reactor has multiple sub-systems that are all going to fail. Any one of these failing sets off an unstoppable meltdown.
